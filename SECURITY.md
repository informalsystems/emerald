# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Emerald, please report it **privately** and **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue.

To report a vulnerability:

- Email: `security@informal.systems`
- Include a clear description of the issue
- Provide steps to reproduce, if possible
- Include affected versions, commit hashes, or configurations
- Add any relevant logs, PoCs, or screenshots

There is no bounty reward system in place for Emerald yet.

## Disclosure Policy and Safe Harbor

We follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. We acknowledge receipt of your report within a reasonable timeframe.
2. We investigate and validate the issue.
3. We develop and test a fix.
4. We coordinate public disclosure after a fix is available.

Please allow us time to address the issue before making any public disclosures.

For the most up-to-date version of the policies that govern our approach to
vulnerability disclosure, please consult
the [Gold Standard Safe Harbor Statement][h1-statement].

Thank you for helping keep Emerald secure.
