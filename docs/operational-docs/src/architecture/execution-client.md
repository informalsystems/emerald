# Ethereum Execution Client

Emerald integrates with Ethereum execution clients through the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine), allowing it to plug into a mature execution ecosystem.
Currently, Emerald integrates with [Reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) and we plan to support additional clients.
