# Architecture

Emerald is a modular framework designed with simplicity at its core, enabling users to deploy reliable, easy to operate, high performance, EVM-compatible networks.
Its architecture is intentionally clean and composable, consisting of three key components:

- [Consensus Layer](consensus.md)  
- [Execution Layer](execution-client.md)
- [Proof-of-Authority Model](poa.md)
