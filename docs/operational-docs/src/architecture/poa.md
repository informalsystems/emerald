# PoA Module

Emerald adopts a proof-of-authority (PoA) model. 
This model fits naturally with institutional networks of trust, where participants are well-known organizations that can use their reputations as stake.
This approach prioritizes accountability and identity over anonymous resource competition, enabling predictable performance, clear governance, and a security model rooted in real-world credibility.
