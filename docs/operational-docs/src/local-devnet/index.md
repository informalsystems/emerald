# Deploy Local Testnet

This guide explains how to create and manage a local Emerald testnet.
The goal is to enable developers and testers to run an Emerald network on their machine for development, testing, and experimentation.

A local testnet is a fully functional blockchain network running entirely on your computer. It provides:

- **Fast iteration**: Test smart contracts and applications without waiting for public networks
- **Complete control**: Add/remove validators, modify network parameters, reset state anytime
- **No cost**: No real tokens required for testing
- **Privacy**: All transactions and data stay on your machine

**Local Testnet vs Production Network**

| Feature | Local Testnet | Production Network |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Validators | All on your machine | Distributed across organizations |
| Data persistence | Can reset anytime | Permanent blockchain history |
| Network access | Localhost only | Public or permissioned network |
| Use case | Development/testing | Real applications |
| Setup time | ~30 seconds | Requires coordination |
